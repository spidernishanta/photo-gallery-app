# photo-gallery-app
The project is to develop a Photo Gallery App, which will help us to evaluate your skills in advanced JavaScript programming.


The requirements for the application are as follows:

The application should asynchronously retrieve the images from a server.

The application should display the images in a gallery layout using HTML and CSS.

The application should allow the user to interact with the gallery, such as clicking on an image to view it in a larger size and buttons to go to the next or previous image.
